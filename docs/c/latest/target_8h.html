<p>This function can be used when you'd like to avoid checking the type of the target and then calling the appropriate close function. Note that use of this doesn't actually avoid the check - it just does the check on your behalf. It is more efficient to call the specific close function if you know the type of the target.</p>

<p>The default target is opened when a logging call is made with no target open. It will not be opened until either this happens or a call to this function is made. It will not be closed until a call to stumpless_free_all() is made. It should not be closed manually outside of the free all function.</p>
<p>Be careful not to confuse this target with the current target, which is the last target opened or set via stumpless_set_current_target(). While these will return the same target in some cases, such as if they are called before opening any targets, they are not equivalent.</p>
<p>The default target type will change depending on the configuration of the system configuration. If Windows Event Log targets are supported, then the default target will log to an event log named <code>STUMPLESS_DEFAULT_TARGET_NAME</code>. If Windows Event Log targets are not supported and socket targets are, then the default target will point at the socket named in STUMPLESS_DEFAULT_SOCKET, which will be /var/run/syslog if it existed at build time, or else /dev/log. If neither of these target types are supported then a file target is opened to log to the file named in <code>STUMPLESS_DEFAULT_FILE</code>.</p>
<p>The default target will not have any options set, and will have a default facility of <code>STUMPLESS_FACILITY_USER</code>. These settings may be modified by calling the appropriate modifiers on the target after retrieving it with this function.</p>

<p>For targets that are opened with a single <code>open</code> function call, they will likely be considered open as long as they are non-NULL, as the target creation would otherwise fail before it could be opened. Targets are be considered in a paused state if they were created but not opened yet, for example with <code>stumpless_new_network_target</code> as opposed to <code>stumpless_open_network_target</code>.
