<p><b>Thread Safety: MT-Safe</b> This function is thread safe. Different target types handle thread safety differently, as some require per-target locks and others can rely on system libraries to log safely, but all targets support thread safe logging in some manner. For target-specific information on how thread safety is supported and whether AS or AC safety can be assumed, refer to the documentation for the target's header file (in the <code>stumpless/target</code> include folder).</p>
<p><b>Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe lock heap</b> This function is not safe to call from signal handlers as some targets make use of non-reentrant locks to coordinate access. It also may make memory allocation calls to create internal cached structures, and memory allocation may not be signal safe.</p>
<p><b>Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe lock heap</b> This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously cancelled, due to the use of locks in some targets that could be left locked and the potential for memory allocation.</p>

<p>Messages that are longer than the maximum size are truncated to this length. If the underlying transport for a network target can support a larger datagram and you need support for longer messages, then you can use this option to increase the size. Likewise, the option can be used to force smaller datagrams if needed, for example in the case of extra overhead in the IP header beyond the typical 20 bytes.</p>
<p>Note that truncations due to the maximum size do not take UTF characters into account. If you have entries using multi-byte characters, then you need to be sure that these truncations do not cause parsing or security problems.</p>
