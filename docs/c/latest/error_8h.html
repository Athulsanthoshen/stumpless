This function will be called for each entry sent to the target, and will be given a pointer to the target itself as well as the entry passed to it. It returns an int with the same semantics as stumpless_add_entry where a non-negative value indicates success and a negative value is returned in the event of an error. The target and entry pointers passed to the function are guaranteed to be non-NULL, since NULL pointers will generate errors before the function is called.</td></tr>

<p>This function does NOT close the stream associated with the target. It does destroy all memory allocated for the target, including the target struct itself.</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: MT-Unsafe</b> This function is not thread safe as it destroys resources that other threads would use if they tried to reference this target.</p>
<p><b>Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe lock heap</b> This function is not safe to call from signal handlers due to the destruction of a lock that may be in use as well as the use of the memory deallocation function to release memory.</p>
<p><b>Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe lock heap</b> This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously cancelled, as the cleanup of the lock may not be completed, and the memory deallocation function may not be AC-Safe itself.</p>

<p>Events logged to this target will be separated by a newline, just as with a file target. In fact, a stream target is equivalent to a file target with the difference being that the file must be opened and closed by the caller.</p>
<p>A stream target can also be useful for logging to other streams, such as stdout and stderr, which is not possible with a file target.</p>
