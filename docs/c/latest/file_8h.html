<p><b>Thread Safety: MT-Safe race:name</b> This function is thread safe, of course assuming that name is not modified by any other threads during execution.</p>
<p><b>Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe heap</b> This function is not safe to call from signal handlers due to the use of memory allocation functions.</p>

<p>Creates or updates the registry entries for displaying log entries in the Windows Event Log for a new event source.</p>
<p>Specifically, the following registry subkey is created, or modified if it already exists: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Stumpless</p>
<p>This key is given the following registry values: Sources: "Stumpless" as an entry, assuming it is a REG_MULTI_SZ.</p>
<p>If an existing Sources key is already present and is not correctly formatted with NULL terminating characters as required by a MULTI_SZ, then this call fails and returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.</p>
<p>A subkey is also created within this key named "Stumpless", with the following values set in it: CategoryCount: 8 (one category is present for each severity in RFC 5424) CategoryMessageFile: Points to the image containing stumpless. EventMessageFile: Points to the image containing stumpless. TypesSupported: 0x1f (all event types are allowed).</p>
<p>This call is semantically equivalent to stumpless_add_wel_event_source_w( L"Stumpless", L"Stumpless", 8, L"stumpless.dll", L"stumpless.dll", NULL, EVENTLOG_AUDIT_FAILURE | EVENTLOG_AUDIT_SUCCESS | EVENTLOG_ERROR_TYPE | EVENTLOG_INFORMATION_TYPE | EVENTLOG_WARNING_TYPE) where L"stumpless.dll" is the full path to the current stumpless module loaded. Note that this may be a DLL or EXE, depending on how the library was compiled in the currently running process.</p>

<p>Windows Events may include insertion strings that are replaced with a specific value provided when logged. This function maps a specific insertion string to a param. The value of the param will then be substituted for that insertion string when an event is logged. If the windows event does not have an insertion string correlating to the given index, it will simply be ignored.</p>
<p>Note that insertion strings use the value of the param at log time. If the value changes between log entries, it will reflect these changes in the log itself as well. This also means that you should not destroy a param unless you are sure that no entries exist that are using it.</p>
<p>Insertion params always take precedence over a insertion string. If an insertion string was set at the same index as a param when it is set, it will effectively be removed and the param value used from then on. If the param value is removed, then the insertion string will be unset, and the previous string will <em>not</em> be restored.</p>

<p>Messages that are longer than the maximum size are truncated to this length. If the underlying transport for a network target can support a larger datagram and you need support for longer messages, then you can use this option to increase the size. Likewise, the option can be used to force smaller datagrams if needed, for example in the case of extra overhead in the IP header beyond the typical 20 bytes.</p>
<p>Note that truncations due to the maximum size do not take UTF characters into account. If you have entries using multi-byte characters, then you need to be sure that these truncations do not cause parsing or security problems.</p>

<p><b>Thread Safety: MT-Safe</b> This function is thread safe. Different target types handle thread safety differently, as some require per-target locks and others can rely on system libraries to log safely, but all targets support thread safe logging in some manner.

<p><b>Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe lock heap</b> This function is not safe to call from signal handlers as some targets make use of non-reentrant locks to coordinate access. It also may make memory allocation calls to create internal cached structures, and memory allocation may not be signal safe.</p>
<p><b>Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe lock heap</b> This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously cancelled, due to the use of locks in some targets that could be left locked and the potential for memory allocation.</p>
